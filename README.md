# scopic-diffusion
Project to fine tune Stable diffusion with images from Ecuadorian artist Oswaldo Gauyasam√≠n. 

In this repo are included the auxiliar jupyter notebooks and configuration files used for the project.

# Generating dataset
The images of the dataset are scraped using BS4 and captioned using BLIP. 
The dataset is published and published 

## Instructions

The training is done in Google Colab PRO using a A100 GPU.
1. Change the configurations in the local *art-ecu.yaml* file. 
1. Run the notebook [**fine_tune.ipynb**](urlcolb). 
    * **NOTE**: the dependencies are installed in the first cell of the notebook.
